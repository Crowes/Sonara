# (Concept) Sonara

Whether you're at a party, sharing the offic speaker, or just at home with a housemate, Sonara will revolutionise the way you listen to music with other people. You don't have to fight over who's got control, and can queue up songs that haven't been downvoted, and songs will be raised higher in the queue when both of you have upvoted them previously.
